## Project Description üìù

The `nimenation` project appears to be a modern web application built with a component-based architecture and a focus on front-end development.  Judging from the file structure, it leverages TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and Vite as a fast and lightweight development build tool. The project structure suggests a single-page application (SPA) design, with distinct sections like "Hero" and "About" indicating a scrollable or tabbed layout. It is likely designed to present information about a specific entity, product, or service.

The absence of a clear, stated purpose in the original description necessitates an educated guess as to the project's objective. Based on typical modern web application patterns, `nimenation` likely aims to provide a responsive, visually appealing, and interactive user interface. The use of TypeScript suggests a focus on code quality and scalability, while Tailwind CSS likely prioritizes rapid prototyping and consistent design. The use of `.bolt` files hints at interaction with a Bolt.js application, suggesting it might be interfacing with some kind of content management or deployment system.

Given the technology stack, `nimenation` is likely targeted towards users seeking a performant and visually engaging web experience. The modular component structure facilitates easy modification and extension of the application's functionality.  The project's design choices suggest a potential use case as a landing page, portfolio, or a concise presentation of information. It caters to developers who appreciate modern tooling, type safety, and a streamlined development workflow.

## Key Features ‚ú®

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**  Built with reusable components (e.g., `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Hero`, `About`) for maintainability and scalability. This facilitates easy updates and the addition of new features without disrupting existing code.
*   **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to ensure the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience across platforms.
*   **TypeScript:** Employs TypeScript for type safety, enhancing code reliability and developer productivity by catching potential errors during development rather than at runtime.
*   **Fast Development with Vite:** Leverages Vite for lightning-fast development server startup and hot module replacement (HMR), allowing developers to see changes instantly and iterate quickly.
*   **ESLint for Code Quality:** Integrates ESLint to enforce code style consistency and identify potential issues, ensuring code readability and maintainability across the project.
*   **Clean and Modular Structure:** Organizes code into logical sections and components, making it easier to understand, navigate, and contribute to the project.

## Installation & Running Locally üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended):  You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   npm, Yarn, or pnpm:  These come with Node.js or can be installed separately.  `npm` is the default.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaeuly/nimenation.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd nimenation
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Alternatively, using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    Or using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Alternatively, using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Or using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. The specific port may vary depending on your Vite configuration.
